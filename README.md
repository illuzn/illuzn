# 👋 Hi, I’m illuzn

I'm a hobbyist coder passionate about home automation, DIY electronics, and open-source. My main focus is on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)—an awesome platform for connecting and automating smart devices.

## 🛠️ Projects

- **Rheem Hot Water Heater Integration**  
  I reverse-engineered the Rheem hot water heater system (Australia) and developed a [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/illuzn/rheem-eziset), enabling advanced monitoring and control. My documentation of the reverse engineered protocol is [also available](https://github.com/illuzn/Rheem-Eziset-Protocol).

- **DIY Soil Moisture Sensor**  
  Designed and built a custom [soil moisture sensor](https://github.com/illuzn/esphome-april-soil-moisture-sensor) that integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant, helping keep my garden healthier and smarter.

- **Useful Home Assistant Things**  
  A repo with my learnings over the last 4 years about Home Assistant particularly on underpowered hardware. My advice on [home assistant's database](https://github.com/illuzn/useful-homeassistant-things/blob/main/database/README.md) and why you should keep database size down. My [automation blueprints](https://github.com/illuzn/useful-homeassistant-things/blob/main/homeassistant-purge-entities-automation/README.md) which will help keep your home assistant database size down.
